Minebase is a game for the Minetest Engine. It is a fork of Minetest Game and thus shares many features with it, but much of the code was refactored to address the discontent with it. This implies that many mods made for Minetest Game won't work in this game. You have to check the dependencies of the mods to be sure. If a mod depends on default or another mod that has been removed or changed significantly, you will get error messages.
Similar to Minetest Game, this game is a base for modding. I am going to add mods with new features, but mods like "More Trees" or "Minetest Game Plus" are not going to be added. Regarding mods quality is more important than quantity. In case you like to mod and want to contribute to this project, use the appropriate tools on Gitlab.

Version 0.1.0.1 is the first release.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
It is possible to convert a Minetest Game world to a Minebase world, but I
didn't write a script to convert a Minebase world back. That is the reason why
you should create a backup before converting your world. Keep in mind that some
mods made for Minetest Game, won't run with Minebase.
This game does not support v6.
legacy.lua was dropped.
TNT was removed because I want the theme of this game to be more medieval.

[b]Contributing[/b]
In case you want to contribute to this game, the code should be structured 
similar to the modpacks already included. The modpack should at least 
consist of two mods, one that provides an API and a second mod using it.
Registry functions that directly or indirectly rely on one of the 
minetest.register_\* functions, should expect two arguments, the name and a 
definition as a table.
If you spot bugs or want to improve the code otherwise, feel free to open 
issues.
