Grants teleportation powers to Mese and gold blocks allowing for teleporter constructions.

When you punch a gold block which is next to a Mese block, you are teleported 100 blocks in the direction of the Mese block. Each additional Mese block placed in a line adds 100 blocks to the distance.

Lines of Mese can also be placed on multiple sides of a gold block to create diagonal teleporters! However, Mese blocks on opposing sides cancel each other's power.

If you don't know what you're doing, you'll likely bury yourself or send yourself into the sky! However, with careful planning, complex teleportation networks can be built to make navigating the land a breeze.
